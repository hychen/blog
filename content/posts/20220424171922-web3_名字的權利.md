名子非常重要。

尤其是在數位時代，網路上的名子，有時候比「本名」還真。乘載的不只是我們在網路上的信譽，更朔造我們的[人格](https://hychen.me/posts/20221002203411-%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E4%BA%BA%E6%A0%BC/)。

[既然之前提過法律的局限性是 Web3 可切入探討的角度](https://hychen.me/posts/20221002194604-%E5%85%B6%E5%AF%A6_%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3_web_3_%E7%94%A2%E6%A5%AD%E9%9C%80%E8%A6%81_%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E4%B8%AD%E4%BB%8B%E6%B3%95_%E9%80%99%E6%A8%A3%E7%AB%8B%E6%B3%95%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E%E7%9A%84%E6%B3%95%E8%A6%8F/)，那順便聊聊網路上，名子註冊爭議吧！在這類案例中，往往是公司決策權力大於國家司法。雖然維根斯坦說：「名子只是對象的指謂」，但孔老爺子更說過：「君子無所爭，必也正名乎？」。我們雖說算不上君子，但名子總是要爭一爭的。

不久前，[Appworks 的分析師林楓](https://appworks.tw/team/natelie-lin/) 寫一了一篇 [fame, opps, (de)centralization, &amp; doxxing](https://mirror.xyz/nataliefenglin.eth/cg6jpNoBlvogwkzcmubqKyNJp9klbCsKnooOopdDIC0?fbclid=IwAR0TJf3LLnsr-icyTgqc1RwNpgS8B5p_CoaD1Pjmepgwr1Ta7aTKpBTtP_E)，講了她的觀察：

> This past week I saw some web3 drama unfolding between 2 ppl I follow on Twitter regarding Coinbase's new NFT marketplace. It involved:
>
> -   Fame: the importance of influence and reputation
> -   Opps: in hip-hop lingo this means "opponents"
> -   (De)centralization: balancing the two
> -   Doxxing: the act of publicly revealing previously private personal information about an individual or organization

由於這個問題在「網路治理」領域基本上算是老生常談，其中影響最重，最典型案例當數 DNS 域名管理。

於是大致上回了ㄧ下：

> This situation can be more serious in the future. People who are interested to build web3 products could probably learn something from this case ICANN faced, which is a more complex situation that is a conflict between the citizen of many countries and a commercial company - "Is Amazon ok to take the .amazon domain name? which were not acceptable by the countries near the amazon river".  In general, the policy of username/organization registration of many web2 services still be regulated by human law and the company behind the product has the power to do any decision on giving the name to who without users’ approval if the name registration is conflict to trademark. But the decision-making on the top-level name of DNS is different, ICANN took the Multi-stakeholder model.

如果有閱讀《數位中介法草案》，你會發現有許多地方是借鑑「DNS 域名管理」的方法論。通常會遇到這個問題，都是因為跨境司法管轄權利喬不攏。但自區塊鏈問世後，線上治理成為顯學，所以也可以想想採用 Web 3的方式來做「價值對齊」(vlaue alginment)，來避開台灣法律管不動境外平台的窘境。

> I were actually not talk that about regulation, I were meaning the ICANN could be think as a DAO but not on chain (like Ethereum were in early days, ICANN was a tech community  also, but later they took the role and responsibility from US gov to self-regulate the whole world DNS) , the experience of governance model of liquid organization  is something could carry over from web2 to web3. For web3 native, from technical view, NFT pass (signing) is very similar to people use GPG key and their passport to build their digital identify, online distributed organization and "the web of trust"  in early days of internet.
>
> so, name registration of web3 app should be 100% free, everyone can register the name they want, but app product should have a board like ICANN to allow users to participate the decision, or even co-create the important policies, to reach the consensus of entire users, team, and the investors behind.

英文是用神器 [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/translator) 翻的。嗯！意思有到就好，講英文很累。

另外，DNS 是最適合做成 NFT ，並有二級市場的應用，但這就需要 TWNIC 點頭。或許數位發展部可以推動一下，使其成為 NFT 跟 DAO 的示範應用。
